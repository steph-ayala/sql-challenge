To complete Module 9 i used outside resources such as Lucidchart.com, xpert learning assistant, postgres and askbcs.

the data modeling portion of the module was done through Lucid chart. I created an ERD diagram and have saved it as a pdf named ERD_chart. It is located in the EmployeeSQL folder.

Along with the chart I have saved all queries .sql and paired with it's corresponding results saved as .csv for the data analysis portion.

For the data engineering part of the assignment I used postgres to accurately make columns with correct data types, primary and foreign keys. I used proper queries to add foreign keys and constraints to columns.

"database.csv" contains all of the tables created with its proper data types and constraints.

This README is also located in EmployeeSQL.
